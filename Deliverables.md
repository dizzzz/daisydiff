### List: ###
  * A literature study with an outline of all the possible algorithms + Testing of existing (proprietary) code. + Explaining the algorithms on the community scratchpad
  * A study of the XML files used by DaisyCMS, which I would need to prioritize on. (Do we want to compare ordered or unordered XML files?)
  * A LCS implementation (could be copied from the current Daisy codebase?)
  * A HTML representation/change syntax that can be used for DaisyCMS
  * One or more graph-based implementations
  * A library with all the options from the project description
  * Documentation
  * Progress updates posted to the community scratchpad (at least weekly)
