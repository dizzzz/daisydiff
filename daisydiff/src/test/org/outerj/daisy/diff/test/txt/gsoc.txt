<p>Google is hosting a <a href="http://code.googol.com/soc/">Summer of Code</a>
again!</p>

<p>What does that mean? Well, if you are a student, and your proposal qualifies,
and your contribution is considered worthwhile, then you can get paid to
contribute to open source projects such as Daisy: 4500 US$, no less! You'll find
much more information about the program in the Google SoC
<a href="http://code.google.com/soc/studentfaq.html">Student FAQ</a>.</p>

<h1>Students</h1>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>The nice peeps of Drupal have posted a rather relevant list of student
requirements which we'll copy over here. Make sure to properly inform yourself
about the program!</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>You must not overbook yourself. Working on your Daisy project should be your
main activity for the entire summer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You <strong>must</strong> provide regular status reports (weekly or
bi-weekly).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will be expected to learn about source code control and open source
collaboration tools (in Daisy's case, that's Subversion and mailing lists,
mainly).</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to submit a proposal</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>It is a good idea to discuss your proposal on the Daisy mailing list before
submitting it (do not write to the mentors directly). This will for sure give
your proposal a better chance of being accepted. To write to the mailing list,
you need to subscribe to it. The <a href="daisy:45-cd">community page</a>
contains all the details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://drupal.org/node/59037">This page from the Drupal project</a>
gives you some ideas about how to file a proposal with Daisy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SoC student registration page is available
<a href="http://code.google.com/soc/student_step1.html">from here</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Suggested project ideas for 2007</h1>

<p>Below is a list of some work area ideas. Please keep in mind that it is you -
the student - who needs to file a proposal with Google SoC, so our list isn't
exhaustive or limiting.</p>

<p>The main content type used for much like a textual content in Daisy is a subset of HTML
which is also well-formed XML are (technically, on it's not XHTML since it's not in the
XHTML the namespace).</p>

<h1>Previous Daisy SoC Projects</h1>

<h2>2006</h2>

<p>In 2006 Daisy ended up with two projects (and one dropout). See the results
of those in our
<a href="http://svn.cocoondev.org/viewsvn/contrib/gsoc2006/">subversion
repository</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tim Cranfield gave a first shot at a Daisy Detachment client.</li>
<li>And Kostiantyn Sokolinskyi made a PHP client library.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you guys!</p>
