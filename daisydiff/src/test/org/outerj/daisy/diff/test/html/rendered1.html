<h1>Introduction</h1>




<p>This  document  describes  the  editor  used  to  modify  pages  stored  in  the

document  repository..  The  editor  features  wysiwyg  editing..</p>




<h2>Where  do  I  find  the  editor??</h2>




<p>The  editor  can  be  reached  by  either  editing  an  existing  document  or  creating

a  new  document..</p>




<p>To  edit  an  existing  document,,  use  the  <span class="diff-tag-removed">[</span>Edit<span class="diff-tag-removed">]</span>  link  in  the<span class="diff-tag-removed"> </span><span class="diff-tag-removed">action</span><span class="diff-tag-removed"> </span><span class="diff-tag-removed">menu</span>  <span class="diff-tag-removed">of</span><span class="diff-tag-removed"> </span><span class="diff-tag-removed">a</span><span class="diff-tag-removed">

This  link  is  only  visible  if  you  are  allowed  to  edit  the  document..</p>




<p>To  create  a  new  document,,  <span class="diff-tag-removed">use</span><span class="diff-tag-added">select</span>  the  <span class="diff-tag-removed">"</span>New  Document<span class="diff-tag-removed">"</span>  link  <span class="diff-tag-removed">(</span>in  the  <span class="diff-tag-removed">top</span><span class="diff-tag-removed">-</span><span class="diff-tag-removed">right</span><span class="diff-tag-removed">
</span><span class="diff-tag-removed">navigation</span><span class="diff-tag-removed">)</span><span class="diff-tag-added">menu</span>..  You  are

then  first  presented  with  a  list  of  document  types,,  after  selecting  one  the

editor  will  open..</p>




<h2>Document  <span class="diff-tag-removed">Type</span><span class="diff-tag-added">type</span>  <span class="diff-tag-removed">Influence</span><span class="diff-tag-added">influence</span>
</h2>




<p>The  content  of  the  edit  screen  depends  somewhat  on  the  document  type  of  the

document  you''re  editing  or  creating..  See  <a>documents</a>

for  a  general  discussion  on  documents  and  document  types..  As  a  quick  reminder,,  a

document  can  consists  of  multiple  parts  and  fields..  The  parts  contain  the  actual

content,,  the  fields  are  for  more  structured  ((meta))data..</p>




<p>If  a  part  is  marked  as  a  ""Daisy  HTML""  part,,  you  will  be  presented  with  a

wysiwyg  editor  for  that  part..  Otherwise,,  a  file  upload  control  will  be  shown..

Because  of  the  ability  to  plugin  in  custom  <a>part

editors</a>,,  other  types  of  editors  might  also  appear  ((e..g..  for  editing  book

definitions))..</p>




<h2>Supported  browsers</h2>




<p>In  theory,,  the  document  editing  screen  should  work  on  most  browsers..  However,,

to  use  wysiwyg  editing,,  it  is  advisable  to  use  a  recent  version  of  one  of  the

mainstream  browsers,,  Mozilla//Firefox  or  Internet  Explorer..  We  do  most  of  our

testing  using  recent  versions  of  Firefox  and  Internet  Explorer  6<span class="diff-tag-added">/</span><span class="diff-tag-added">/</span><span class="diff-tag-added">7</span>..</p>




<p>On  other  browsers,,  the  editor  will  fall  back  to  a  textarea  allowing  you  to

edit  the  HTML  source..  On  browsers  that  support  wysiwyg  editing,,  you  can  also

switch  to  source  editing..</p>




<p>In  any  case,,  Javascript  ((and  cookies))  must  be  enabled..</p>




<h2>Heartbeat</h2>




<p>While  editing  a  page,,  the  server  keeps  some  state  about  your  editing  session..

After  a  certain  period  of  inactivity,,  the  server  will  clean  up  the  editing

session..  To  avoid  the  editing  session  to  expire  while  you''re  working  on  a

document,,  a  ''heartbeat''  signal  keeps  your  session  alive..  <span class="diff-tag-removed">(</span><span class="diff-tag-removed">Technically</span><span class="diff-tag-added">The</span>  <span class="diff-tag-removed">speaking</span><span class="diff-tag-removed">,</span><span class="diff-tag-added">heartbeat</span>  <span class="diff-tag-removed">this</span><span class="diff-tag-added">signal</span>

<h2>Document  locking</h2>




<p>When  you  edit  an  existing  document,,  the  daisywiki  will  automatically  take  an

exclusive  lock  on  the  document  to  ensure  nobody  else  can  edit  the  document  while

you''re  working  on  it..  The  duration  of  the  initial  lock  is  15  minutes,,  the  lock

is  then  automatically  extended  if  needed  via  the  heartbeat  signal..</p>




<p>If  you  start  editing  a  page  but  decide  you  didn''t  want  to  after  all,,  it  is

best  to  use  the  ""Cancel  editing""  button  at  the  bottom  of  the  edit  screen,,  so

that  your  lock  get  cleared..  If  you  don''t  do  this,,  the  lock  will  expire  after  at

most  15  minutes,,  so  this  is  not  a  big  problem..</p>




<p>The  locking  behaviour  can  be  adjusted  by  the  site  administrator..

For  example,,  the  locking  can  be  turned  of  completely..  However,,  we  expect  that  in

most  cases  it  will  be  left  to  the  default  behaviour  described  here..</p>




<h2>Editing  multiple  documents  at  once</h2>




<p>Editing  multiple  documents  concurrently  in  different  browser  windows  or  tabs

is  supported..</p>




<h1>Supported  HTML  subset  and  HTML  cleaning</h1>




<p>Although  a  wysiwyg  editor  is  shown  for  the  ""Daisy  HTML""  parts,,  the  goal  is  to

limit  the  editing  to  a  subset  of  HTML  mainly  focussing  on  structural  aspects  of

HTML..  So  forget  fonts,,  colors,,  special  styling  tricks,,  embedded  javascript,,  and

so  on..  Inserting  those  while  editing  in  source  view  won''t  work  either,,  as  the

HTML  is  cleaned  up  on  the  server  side..</p>




<p>This  cleanup  process  can  also  be  triggered  manually,,  by  pressing  the  ""Cleanup

edited  HTML""  button..  This  can  be  useful  if  you  pasted  content  copied  from  an

external  application  and  you  want  to  see  how  it  will  look  finally..  When

switching  from  wysiwyg  to  source  view,,  the  cleanup  is  also  performed..</p>




<h2>Supported  HTML  subset</h2>




<p>These  are  the  supported  tags  ((or  ""elements""))  and  attributes::</p>




<ul>


<li>&lt;html&gt;  and  &lt;body&gt;</li>


<li>&lt;p&gt;  with  optional  attributes  align  and  class..  The  class  attribute  is

only  kept  if  it  has  one  of  the  following  values::  note,,  warn,,  fixme</li>


<li>&lt;br&gt;</li>


<li>&lt;pre&gt;  with  optional  class  attribute..  The  class  attribute  is  only  kept

if  has  one  of  the  following  values::  query,,  include,,  query--and--include</li>


<li>&lt;h1&gt;,,  &lt;h2&gt;,,  &lt;h3&gt;,,  &lt;h4&gt;,,  &lt;h5&gt;</li>


<li>&lt;a&gt;  with  required  attribute  href..  If  the  href  attribute  is  missing,,

the  &lt;a&gt;  will  be  dropped..</li>


<li>&lt;strong&gt;,,  &lt;em&gt;,,  &lt;sup&gt;,,  &lt;sub&gt;,,  &lt;tt&gt;,,

&lt;del&gt;</li>


<li>&lt;ul&gt;,,  &lt;ol&gt;,,  &lt;li&gt;</li>


<li>&lt;blockquote&gt;</li>


<li>&lt;img&gt;  with  attributes  src  and  align  ((optional))</li>


<li>&lt;table&gt;  with  optional  attribute  class,,  &lt;tbody&gt;,,  &lt;tr&gt;,,

&lt;td&gt;,,  &lt;th&gt;..  &lt;td&gt;  and  &lt;th&gt;  can  have  the  attributes

colspan,,  rowspan  and  valign</li>


</ul>




<p>All  tags  not  listed  above  will  be  removed  ((but  their  character  content  will

remain))..  On  the  block--type  elements  and  images,,  the  id  attribute  is  supported..

For  the  most  accurate  list  of  elements  and  attributes,,  have  a  look  at  the

htmlcleaner..xml  file  ((see  below))..</p>




<p>The  supported  tags  can  have  any  content  model  as  allowed  by  the  HTML  DTD,,  but

of  course  limited  to  the  supported  tags..  If  an  element  occurs  in  a  location

where  it  is  not  supported,,  an  ancestor  is  searched  where  it  is  allowed  and  the

containing  element((s))  are  ended,,  the  element  inserted,,  and  the  containing

elements  reopened..  This  happens  for  example  when  a  &lt;table&gt;  occurs  inside  a

&lt;p&gt;..</p>




<p>&lt;b&gt;  and  &lt;i&gt;  are  translated  to  &lt;strong&gt;  and  &lt;em&gt;

respectively,,  as  are  &lt;span&gt;  tags  with  font--weight//font--style

specifications..</p>




<p>If  two  or  more  &lt;br&gt;  tags  appear  after  one  another,,  this  is  translated

to  a  paragraph  split..  The  meaningless  &lt;br&gt;''s  that  the  Mozilla  editor  tends

to  leave  everywhere  are  removed..  Text  that  appears  directly  in  the  &lt;body&gt;

is  wrapped  inside  &lt;p&gt;  elements..</p>




<p>&lt;br&gt;  tags  inside  &lt;pre&gt;  are  translated  to  newlines  characters..</p>




<p>The  result  is  serialized  as  a  XML--well--formed  HTML  document  ((not  XHTML))

((UTF--8  encoded))..  Lines  are  split  at  80  characters  ((if  possible)),,  meaningless

whitespace  is  removed..</p>




<p>All  this  should  also  ensure  that  the  resulting  HTML  is  ((mostly))  the  same

whether  it  is  edited  using  Mozilla  or  Internet  Explorer..</p>




<p>The  supported  tags,,  attributes  and  classes  for  &lt;p&gt;  are  not

hardcoded  but  can  be  configured  in  a  file  ((htmlcleaner..xml))..  However,,  making

arbitrary  adjustments  to  this  file  is  not  supported  ((the  html--cleaner  code

expects  certain  tags  to  be  there))..  Adding  new  tags  or  attributes  should

generally  not  be  a  problem,,  but  those  won''t  have  the  necessary  GUI  editing

support  unless  you  implement  that  also..</p>




<h1>Images</h1>




<p>Images  can  be  inserted  either  by  browsing  for  an  existing  image  in  the

repository,,  or  by  uploading  a  new  image  in  the  repository..  You  can  also  insert

images  that  are  not  in  the  repository,,  but  available  at  some  URL..</p>




<p>You  can  change  the  alignment  of  the  images  ((using  the  usual  text--align

buttons)),,  and  change  how  the  text  flows  around  the  image..  This  last  option  won''t

have  effect  in  the  PDF  output..</p>




<p>Note  that  images  are  also  documents  in  the  repository,,  thus  are  versioned  and

such..  If  you  have  an  updated  version  of  an  image  you  want  to  insert,,  it  is

recommend  to  NOT  delete  the  existing  image  and  upload  the  new  image,,  but  rather

go  to  the  document  editor  for  that  image  ((you  can  use  the  ""Open  image  <span class="diff-tag-removed">document</span><span class="diff-tag-added">in</span><span class="diff-tag-added"> </span><span class="diff-tag-added"> </span><span class="diff-tag-added">new</span><span class="diff-tag-added">
</span><span class="diff-tag-added">
</span><span class="diff-tag-added">window</span>""<span class="diff-tag-added"> </span><span class="diff-tag-added"> </span><span class="diff-tag-added">toolbar</span>  button  for  this)),,  and  upload  the  new  version  over  there..</p>




<p>Currently  it  is  hardcoded  that  images  <span class="diff-tag-removed">use</span><span class="diff-tag-added">should</span><span class="diff-tag-added"> </span><span class="diff-tag-added"> </span><span class="diff-tag-added">have</span><span class="diff-tag-added"> </span><span class="diff-tag-added"> </span><span class="diff-tag-added">an</span>  <span class="diff-tag-removed">the</span><span class="diff-tag-added">"</span><span class="diff-tag-added">"</span><span class="diff-tag-added">ImageData</span><span class="diff-tag-added">"</span><span class="diff-tag-added">"</span>

<h1>Links</h1>




<p>The  format  of  links  to  other  documents  in  the  daisy  repository  is::</p>




<pre>daisy::&lt;document  id&gt;

for  example::

daisy::167<span class="diff-tag-removed">
</span>
</pre>




<p>The  daisy  link  can  furthermore  include  branch,,  language  and  version

specifications::</p>




<pre>daisy::&lt;document  id&gt;@&lt;branch  name  or  id&gt;::&lt;language  name  or  id&gt;::&lt;version  id&gt;<span class="diff-tag-removed">
</span>
</pre>




<p>Each  of  these  additional  parts  is  optional..  For  example  to  link  to  version  5

of  document  167,,  on  the  same  branch  and  language  as  the  current  document

variant,,  use::</p>




<pre>daisy::167@::::5<span class="diff-tag-removed">
</span>
</pre>




<p>The  <tt>&lt;version  id&gt;</tt>  can  be  a  number  or  the  strings  <tt>last</tt>

or  <tt>live</tt>..</p>




<p>If  you  don''t  know  the  id  of  a  document  by  heart  ((which  is  likely  the  case)),,

use  the  ""Create  link  by  searching""  button  on  the  toolbar..</p>




<p>A  link  can  furthermore  contain  a  fragment  identifier..  A  fragment  identifier

is  used  to  directly  link  to  a  specific  element  ((e..g..  a  heading  or  a  table))  in  a

document..  For  this  you  first  need  to  assign  an  ID  to  the  element  you  want  to

link  to  ((there  is  an  ""Edit  ID""  for  this  on  the  toolbar)),,  and  then  you  can  adjust

the  link..  The  link  editor  dialogs  make  it  easy  by  allowing  to  browse  for

available  element  IDs..</p>




<h1>Upload  and  link  ((""attachment""))</h1>




<p>TODO</p>




<h1>Includes</h1>




<p>It  is  possible  to  include  other  documents  into  the  document  you  are  editing..

For  this,,  choose  ""Include""  in  the  style  dropdown,,  and  enter  a  ""daisy::""  link  in

the  paragraph<span class="diff-tag-added">.</span><span class="diff-tag-added">.</span>  <span class="diff-tag-removed">(</span><span class="diff-tag-removed">there</span><span class="diff-tag-added">There</span>  <span class="diff-tag-removed">is</span><span class="diff-tag-added">are</span>  <span class="diff-tag-removed">a</span><span class="diff-tag-added">also</span>  <span class="diff-tag-removed">button</span><span class="diff-tag-added">buttons</span>  <span class="diff-tag-removed">on</span><span class="diff-tag-added">in</span>  the  toolbar  to<span class="diff-tag-added"> </span><span class="diff-tag-added"> </span><span class="diff-tag-added">directly</span>  insert  <span class="diff-tag-removed">this</span><span class="diff-tag-added">such</span><span class="diff-tag-added"> </span><span class="diff-tag-added"> </span><span class="diff-tag-added">an</span><span class="diff-tag-added">

<p>The  system  checks  for  recursive  includes  ((when  the  document  is  published,,  not

when  it  is  edited))..  If  a  recursive  include  occurs,,  an  error  notice  will  be  shown

at  the  location  of  the  include..</p>




<p>It  is  also  possible  to  include  other  sources  into  your  document,,  for  example

""http::""  or  ""cocoon::""  URLs  ((however,,  see  <a>Include

Permissions</a>))..  In  that  case,,  those  URLs  must  produce  an  embeddable  chunk  of

HTML  in  the  form  of  well--formed  XML..  These  includes  are  currently  only  supported

in  the  HTML  publishing,,  thus  not  for  PDFs..</p>




<h1>Embedded  queries</h1>




<p>It  is  possible  to  embed  a  query  in  a  page..  To  do  this,,  put  your  cursor  on  an

empty  line,,  and  choose  ""Query""  in  the  style  dropdown..  The  style  of  the  paragraph

will  change  to  indicate  it  will  now  be  interpreted  as  a  query..  Then  enter  the

query  in  the  paragraph..</p>




<p>The  query  must  be  written  in  the  Daisy  <a>Query

Language</a>..  It  is  advisable  to  first  try  out  your  query  via  the  ""Query  Search""

page,,  and  once  it  works  and  gives  the  expected  results,,  to  copy  and  paste  it  in

the  document..</p>




<p>If  you  save  a  document  containing  an  invalid  query,,  an  error  notice  will  be

shown  at  the  location  of  the  query..</p>




<h1>Query  and  Include</h1>




<p>The  ""Query--Include""  option  allows  to  specify  a  query,,  and  the  documents

returned  by  that  query  will  be  included  ((rather  then  showing  the  query  results))..

This  allows  to  quickly  created  an  aggregated  document  without  needing  to

manually  insert  includes..</p>




<p>It  is  not  important  what  you  put  in  the  ""select""  part  of  the  query,,  you  can

simply  do  ""select  id  where  ........""..</p>




<h1>IDs  and  fragment  identifiers</h1>




<p>It  is  not  only  possible  to  link  to  a  document,,  but  also  to  a  specific

location  in  a  document..  The  element  to  which  you  want  to  link  ((a  header,,  image,,

......))  must  have  an  ID  assigned..  To  do  this,,  place  the  cursor  inside  the  element

to  which  to  assign  the  ID,,  and  then  press  the  ""Edit  ID""  button  on  the  toolbar..

</p>




<p>Then  to  link  to  the  specific  element,,  just  insert  a  link  like  you  always  do..

Both  the  ""Create  link""  and  ""Create  link  by  searching""  dialogs  allow  to  select

the  ID  from  the  target  document  ((in  the  ""fragment  ID""  field))..  In  the  HTML

source,,  the  target  ID  is  specified  in  the  link  as  in  this  example::</p>




<pre>daisy::5#notes</pre>
<a class="diff-tag-changed" href="#">
<span>An old &lt;pre&gt; tag was removed. 
</span></a><a class="diff-tag-changed" href="#">
<span>An old &lt;pre&gt; tag was removed. 
</span></a>
<span class="diff-tag-removed">
</span>

<p>This  link  will  cause  the  browser  to  scroll  to  the  element  with  an  ID

attribute  with  the  value  ""notes""..  The  part  starting  from  the  hash  sign  is  called

the  ""fragment  identifier""..</p>




<p>Explicit  anchor  elements  ((e..g..  HTML  <tt>&lt;a  name==""notes""//&gt;</tt>))  are  not

supported,,  as  these  sort  of  elements  are  not  visible  in  the  wysiwyg  editor  and

thus  users  would  work  blindly  if  these  were  used  ((deleting  or  moving  them

without  being  aware  of  it,,  and  being  impossible  to  edit  in  wysiwyg  mode))..</p>

<h1>Editing  hints</h1>




<h2>Firefox  and  Mozilla</h2>




<p>Pressing  enter  once  in  Firefox  inserts  a  newline  ((a  &lt;br&gt;))..  To  start  a

new  paragraph,,  press  enter  twice..</p>




<p>The  toolbar  buttons  for  cut//copy//paste  won''t  work  because  of  security

restrictions,,  though  you  can  configure  Firefox  to  allow  this  for  a  specific

site..  More  information  is  given  when  you  click  on  one  of  these  buttons  while  in

Firefox..  However,,  using  the  keyboard  shortcuts  you  can  perform  these  operations

without  any  special  configuration..</p>




<p>When  you  add  a  link  or  apply  a  styling  to  some  words  on  the  end  of  a  line,,  it

might  be  difficult  ((read::  impossible))  to  ''move  after''  the  link  or  styling..  You

can  interrupt  the  link  or  styling  by  moving  the  cursor  to  the  end  of  the  line,,

and  pressing  the  ''Remove  link''  or  ''Remove  formatting''  button  ((thus  without

making  a  selection))..</p>




<h2>Internet  Explorer  ((IE))</h2>




<p>Merging  table  cells  in  IE  works  a  bit  counter--intuitive..  You  cannot  simply

select  multiple  cells  and  click  on  the  merge  cell  button..  Instead,,  put  the

cursor  in  one  cell,,  and  click  on  the  merge  cell  button..  You  will  then  be  asked

how  many  rows  and  columns  you  want  to  merge<span class="diff-tag-added">.</span><span class="diff-tag-added">.</span>

<h1>Character  Set  Information</h1>




<p>By  default,,  daisy  is  configured  to  use  unicode  ((UTF--8))  everywhere..  For  the

part  content  you  enter  in  the  wysiwyg  or  source  editor,,  you  can  use  whatever

unicode--supported  characters  ((more  correctly,,  it  is  limited  by  as  far  as  Java

supports  unicode))..  Metadata  however,,  such  as  the  document  name,,  fields,,  etc  is

stored  in  a  relational  database,,  MySQL,,  which  needs  to  be  configured  with  a

certain  encoding  ((in  West--Europe  often  latin1))  and  hence  is  limited  to  the

characters  supported  by  that  encoding..  Contact  your  system  administrator  if  you

which  to  know  what  encoding  that  is,,  and  thus  to  what  characters  ((glyphs))  you''re

limited..</p>
